# Physics-of-Cats-Simulation

Modelling the physics of falling cats via:

### Model 1 - Stable's model (in progress)
- Cat is modelled as a rigid bead
- Rotates around an imaginary fixed point along the surface of a sphere
- Doesn't conserve angular momentum

### Model 2 - Peano's model (to do)
- Cat is modelled as two rigid cyliders
- Cylinders rotate in opposite directions (conserving angular momentum)

### Model 3 - Bend & Twist model (to do)
- Cat is modelled as two rigid cylinders bent at an angle to each other
- Cyliders rotate in opposite directions (conserving angular momentum)
